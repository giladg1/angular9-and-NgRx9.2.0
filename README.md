# Description

A small example on how to implement NgRx (version 9.2.0) with Angular (version 9). with a lazy loaded feature module (Apple) and without (Banana)
inspiration came from ng-conf 2019 crash course: angular and ngRx.
In this example: we will create a banana item with color, size and rating.
option 1 --> create banana item locally
option 2 --> create banana item with effects and a fake http service
you can than change size parameters with injected value and without injected value.
